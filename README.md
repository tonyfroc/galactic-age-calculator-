## Description

The Super Galactic Age Calculator takes a user's age and ethnicity as inputs. Depending upon their ethnicity, a average life expectancy is returned. When the user interface is built out, a user will choose a planet - Mercury, Venus, Mars or Jupiter - and the application will return the user's age in years depending on which planet they choose. Additionally, a user will be returned the amount of years they have remaining to live on that planet. If they have exceeded their life expectancy on the alien planet, it will return a string with the amount of years they have exceeded their Earth life expectancy on the alien planet.
